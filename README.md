# How to use this plugin?

If you install this plugin you see a small blue arrow icon in your toolbar.

It gets enabled, if a java run configuration was selected.  
Click on it, and it will start your program, combined with the SwingExplorer.  
The SwingExplorer will show up in a new window and looks like this:

On the left side you get a complete overview of your swing component tree. Doubleclick on any item to "select" it and display it inside the main window. In the main part you then get a browseable
overview of your component - just try hovering over a component there!

On the lower side there are different properties, the addition stacktrace, and much more.
